     * Website
   * **[Example for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.example.app)**

     * iOS app (available from the “App Store”, a digital distribution platform operated by Apple Inc.)
   * This privacy policy governs your use of our services regardless of the domain names, operating systems, platforms or devices that are used to access the services, and regardless of whether such access is in connection with an account or not.
   * As a condition for your use of our services as a customer, user or visitor (collectively referred to as a “user” or as your “use”), you consent to the terms of this policy and you agree that your personal information will be handled as outlined below.
 * **Our principles**
   * We never sell, rent out or trade any of our user’s personal information with third parties for commercial purposes.
   * We always collect only the minimum amount of personal information necessary to provide our services to you, unless you choose to provide more such information voluntarily.
   * We encourage you to give us, and, more generally, any provider of digital services, only the amount of data you are comfortable sharing. If in doubt, rather do not share sensitive information.
   * We offer you simple ways to view, update or delete the data we have collected about you.
 * **Children’s Online Privacy Protection**
   * None of our services are designed for, intended to attract, or directed towards children under the age of 13.
   * We never knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If you are a child below that age, you may not use any of our services.
   * If we have any plausible reason to believe that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will have to prohibit you from continuing your use of our services.
   * Should you believe that we might have any personal information of a child under the age of 13, in particular a child of your own, please contact us so that the data in question can be deleted, if appropriate. For our contact information, please see further below.
 * **Email communication**
   * You may opt out of receiving any newsletters or promotional messages from us at any time.
   * This is possible either by using the “Unsubscribe” feature at the bottom of such emails that we may send, or by adjusting the settings in your account within our services, where applicable.
   * You will continue to receive essential, non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as technical notices, order confirmations, or other service-related messages, which are required for us to be able to provide our services to you.
 * **Cookies**
   * Cookies are minimal text files that contain small amounts of data. They are transferred from our servers to your device through your web browser or app. Your web browser or app then sends these small text files back to us whenever you access our services.
   * These cookies do not necessarily contain any personal or identifying information. They are, however, commonly used to store a unique identifier for every individual user, so that our servers do not lose information on who you are while you are moving through the individual parts of our services.
   * We may use cookies and similar technologies, such as “Web Storage” (specifically “localStorage”) and “Internal Storage”, to make interactions with our services more convenient, efficient and secure. For example, we may use these technologies to keep you signed in and to remember your preferences with regard to our services.
   * As such, cookies and the related technologies are essential for the operation of our services. You therefore consent to our use of cookies and related technologies when using our services. Without these technologies, use of our services would not be reasonably possible.
   * Your web browser or operating system usually provides means to delete such data currently stored on your device. They may even provide methods to disable the use of such technologies completely. You are welcome to make use of these settings and features of your web browser or operating system, but that may prevent our services from working correctly for you. For more information on how to delete such data currently stored on your device, please refer to the manual or help section of your web browser or operating system.
   * **Third-party cookies**
     * Some contents of our services are provided by third parties that are not directly affiliated with us.
     * These external contents, which are displayed, rendered, played back or otherwise conveyed directly within our services, may include advertising, analytics and components from social media.
     * The third parties that provide these contents may store cookies on your device for their own purposes and interests, which we cannot control.
     * The settings and features of your web browser or operating system may allow you to control how third parties can store cookies on your device.
 * **Information we collect and why we collect it**
   * **Server logs**
     * Whenever you access our services, including your access of any individual part or section of our services, we record certain information about the nature of your access. That information is never combined with information from other data sources and will not be associated with the identity of any account. However, we reserve the right to review the data retrospectively if there is specific evidence supporting the suspicion of a case of fraud or any other illegal activity or illegal use of our services.
     * We use this information for the provision, maintenance and administration of our services and to monitor and protect the security of our services.

 * **Mandatory disclosure**
   * Laws in the jurisdictions that we operate in may obligate us to disclose certain personal information or other information that we collect about our users to local law enforcement authorities.
   * We may be compelled to such disclosure in response to a court order, a warrant or a similar request by a judicial body or a government agency, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our rights or property, that of any third party, or the safety of the general public.
   * In any case, we will provide data only to the extent necessary to satisfy the request, and, whenever possible and legally permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify affected users of any such disclosure.
 * **Retention and deletion of data**
   * We will retain certain pieces of personal information for as long as you use our services, as long as your account exists, or as long as needed for us to be able to provide our services to you.
   * If you would like to cancel your use of our services, delete your account, or delete your personal information, you may do so in the respective sections of our services. If you need help, please contact us. See further below for our contact information.
   * In order to prevent loss of data due to human errors or system failures, we keep additional backup copies of data, as most companies and service providers do, which may include some of your personal information. This means that parts of your personal information may temporarily remain on our servers even after deletion or termination of your use of our services.
   * We may retain and use your personal information and data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our rights and agreements.
 * **Service providers, contractors and agents**
   * From time to time, we may share some information we have collected from you, including personal information, with a limited number of third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, resellers, agents or business partners, solely for the purpose of performing certain functions on our behalf.
   * Such third parties help us provide and improve our services. Functions performed by them on our behalf may include payment processing, network data transmission, fraud prevention, customer support management and similar services.
   * These third parties do not have any right to use the information that we share about you beyond what is necessary to assist us with the specific task at hand.
 * **Mergers and acquisitions**
   * If we are involved in a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of our business or assets, your information will likely be among the assets transferred.
   * If any such change of ownership happens, the organization receiving your personal information will have to respect the promises that we have made in any pre-existing privacy policy such as this one.
   * You will be notified via a prominent notice within our services or by email to the primary email address specified in your account at least 30 days before any such transfer of your personal information. This notification will include help on choices you may have regarding the transfer and treatment of your personal information.
 * **How we secure your information**
   * We take the trust that you place in us very seriously. We have therefore implemented all measures reasonably necessary to protect the personal information of our users from unauthorized access, modification, deletion, disclosure or other misuse.
   * We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the data submitted to us, both during transmission and after we have received it, and continue to expand our protections as becomes necessary with changing technology.
   * In particular, all connections to and from our services are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) technologies.
   * However, please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no method of electronic transmission or storage is perfectly secure and no measures can guarantee absolute security. Hardware or software failure as well as other factors may compromise the security of user information, as is the case with all other providers of digital services.
   * Apart from that, please recognize that protecting your personal information is, in other parts, also your own responsibility. Especially, you are responsible for safeguarding any passwords and other authentication information that you use to access our services, as well as limiting physical access to the devices used.
   * You should never disclose your authentication information to any third party and you should notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
 * **Links to external websites, applications and products**
   * Some parts and sections of our services may contain external links to websites, applications or products owned by and operated by third parties.
   * We advise you to verify the privacy practices of those third parties individually. We have no knowledge about and are not responsible for the way that those third parties handle any personal information which you provide to them yourself.
   * We encourage you not to provide any personal information to those third parties before assuring yourself of proper privacy practices on their part.
 * **Right to information**
   * You have the right to request at any time, free of charge, information about your personal data stored by us.
   * In addition to that, where applicable, you are entitled to have this data corrected, blocked or deleted. For our contact information, please see further below.
 * **Changes to this privacy policy**
   * We may change this privacy policy from time to time. Most changes will presumably be minor only and will therefore not affect your rights.
   * Should there be any substantial changes to this policy with material effects on any of your rights or choices, you will be notified via a prominent notice within our services or by email to the primary email address specified in your account at least 30 days prior to such changes taking effect. This notification will include help on choices you may have regarding the treatment of your personal information.
   * For any less significant changes to this privacy policy that do not affect your rights or choices in a material way, we encourage all users to check this policy for updated versions periodically.
